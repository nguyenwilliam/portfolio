            identify relevant bibliometrics within the Dimensions database, compile an aggregated spreadsheet with data from the AgNIC partner instiutions, 
          and to analyze that data. The information is to be used by AgNIC executives when managing the allocation of resources. </div>
          <div class="body-text">In short, the objective was to compile publication data of AgNIC partners to see where their strengths lie in different research
            areas.

        <div class="body-text">As this project was focused on AgNIC partners, the query was searching for publications within the 12 agricultural subject 
          categories. This was important as many of the instiutions do publish in other non-agricultural research areas. This leaves us with 3,457,026
          publications among the 48 partners. The data returned included information such as times_cited, type, year, category, and partner. That is a lot 
          of information to handle. Let's look at some visuals that might be easier to analyze.
