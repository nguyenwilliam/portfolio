          <div class="body-text">The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) above shows the structure of the database. It contains 10 tables, whose data 
            types were carefully chosen to fit what I expected the data to look like. Because a series could have multiple episodes, the 'tv_series' and 'tv_episodes'
          are connected in a one-to-many relationship. A 'directors' table was created instead of listing the director under 'movies' was because a director could 
        work on more than one film and having the extra table would ensure normalization. Or in the case of a movie having more than one director. This is also
      why the linking table 'movies_has_directors' has a many-to-many relationship. This same logic led to the creation of the other linking tables.   </div>

      <div class="body-text">This function will return a list of items (movies, books, candy bars) that are rated higher than the average rating of all items
        in that category. This could help business owners decide which products to continue selling or discontinue. Or which employees deserve a bonus, raise, or 
        promotion.

      In this case it was the rating of all of their movies and their total box office gross, but could be applied to shopping frequency or
