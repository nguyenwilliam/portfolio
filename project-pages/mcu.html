          <div class="body-text">The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) above shows the structure of the database. It contains 10 tables, whose data 
            types were carefully chosen to fit what I expected the data to look like. Because a series could have multiple episodes, the 'tv_series' and 'tv_episodes'
          are connected in a one-to-many relationship. A 'directors' table was created instead of listing the director under 'movies' was because a director could 
        work on more than one film and having the extra table would ensure normalization. Or in the case of a movie having more than one director. This is also
      why the linking table 'movies_has_directors' has a many-to-many relationship. This same logic led to the creation of the other linking tables.   </div>
